Whisper Script
This script provides a user-friendly graphical user interface (GUI) for interacting with OpenAI's Whisper, an automatic speech recognition program. Within this interface, users can configure various Whisper options, including the selection of an audio folder and a report folder. Additionally, the script allows users to choose the Whisper model size—small, medium, or large—based on their specific needs. Once configured, the script will automatically transcribe all audio files located in the selected audio folder.
